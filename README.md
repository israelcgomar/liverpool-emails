dmrqx Boilerplate
===================

Yo! This is my first attempt at a [**Gulp**](https://gulpjs.com/)  powered front-end boilerplate.
I'm currently using version  [4.0](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/tree/4.0).

----------

The tools
-------------
There's really nothing much to this boilerplate ~~yet~~.
It makes use of:

- npm
- Node.js
- Gulp
- Pug
- Stylus


Have fun (:
-------------
Assuming you already have npm and Node.js installed:

```sh
$ cd dmrqx-boilerplate
$ npm install
```

After that, if you want to fiddle with the sample code you can run each of the following commands in different terminal windows:
```sh
$ gulp serve
$ http-server
```

> **Note:**
> The _http-server_ command assumes you have npm's [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server) package installed.


What's next?
-------------

- Add browser sync functionally to help during development
- Add image optimization
- So. much. more!
